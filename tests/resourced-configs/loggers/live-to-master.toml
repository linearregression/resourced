#
# Loggers pull log lines from either:
#   * A file
#   * or live TCP payload
# and forwards them to various external sources.
#
# This config file is an example on how to forward log lines received from TCP listener to master.

GoStruct = "Base"
Path = "/live/master"

# Buffer every X interval before flushing to multiple [[Targets]]
Interval = "60s"

# If a source is "live://" then we are forwarding log lines from direct TCP receiver.
# Otherwise, we are pulling log lines from a file. Examples:
#    Source = "live://"
#    Source = "/var/log/messages"
Source = "live://"

# When reading from file, the agent is buffering the log lines temporarily in memory.
# To protect the agent from consuming too much memory, this setting is needed.
# If number of log lines stored in memory exceeded this threshold, log lines will be cleared.
# Note: This setting is not needed when reading source from "live://"
BufferSize = 1000000

# One logger config can have multiple targets.
# To define multiple targets, we are using TOML's array of tables syntax. Example:
# [[Targets]]
# Payload = ""
# Endpoint = ""
# AllowList = []
# DenyList = []
#
# List of payload to choose from:
# - syslog-rfc3164: Syslog RFC 3164
# - syslog-rfc5424: Syslog RFC 5424
#
# By default, payload is plain text string with \n delimiter.
# Between ResourceD daemons, payload is custom defined. User does not need to care.
#
# List of endpoints to choose from:
# - ResourceD Master API endpoint. Example: "http://RESOURCED_MASTER_URL/api/logs"
# - ResourceD Agent TCP endpoint. Example: "resourced+tcp://remote-ip:port"
# - Syslog endpoints: "syslog+udp://remote-ip:514", "syslog+tcp://remote-ip:601", "syslog+tcp+tls://remote-ip:6514"
# - Generic TCP: "tcp://remote-ip:port"
#
# AllowList and DenyList are exclusive to each other. You can only have one or the other.
#    When AllowList is enabled, no log lines will be forwarded except the one that matches AllowList regex.
#    When DenyList is enabled, all log lines will be forwarded except the one that matches DenyList regex.
#    When both are defined, only AllowList will be used.
#    When neither AllowList nor DenyList are defined, all log lines will be forwarded.
# Examples:
#    AllowList = ["com.mysql.mysqld"]
#    DenyList = []
# By default, everything is forwarded.

[[Targets]]
# Payload setting is not needed when having master as endpoint.
Endpoint = "http://RESOURCED_MASTER_URL/api/logs"
