# If a file is "live://" then we are forwarding log lines from direct TCP/UDP receiver.
# Otherwise, we are forwarding log lines from files.
# Note that you can define multiple files. Examples:
#    Files = ["live://"]
#    Files = ["/var/log/messages"]
Files = ["live://", "/private/var/log/system.log"]

# To protect the agent from consuming too much memory, this setting is needed.
# When number of log lines stored in memory exceeded this threshold, log lines in-memory will be cleared.
# Note: general.toml MaxLengthWipeTrigger will be used for clearing log lines from direct TCP/UDP receiver.

# One logger config, one target. There are multiple ways to define a target:
#    Special ResourceD Master API endpoint:

#    Syslog endpoint:
#        Target = "syslog+udp://remote-ip:514"
#        Target = "syslog+tcp://remote-ip:601"
#        Target = "syslog+tcp+tls://remote-ip:6514"
#    Generic TCP
#        Target = "tcp://remote-ip:port"
#    Generic UDP
#        Target = "tcp://remote-ip:port"
